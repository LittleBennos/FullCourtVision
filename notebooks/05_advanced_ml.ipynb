    "## Summary & Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Player Trajectory Prediction\n",
    "- A gradient boosting model with time-series features beats the naive \"last season\" baseline\n",
    "- **Most predictive features**: recent PPG, scoring trend, and career mean — classic regression-to-the-mean effects\n",
    "- Junior basketball is inherently noisy; even the best model has substantial residual variance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Elo Rankings\n",
    "- Our Elo system processes 40,000+ games across all Victorian competitions\n",
    "- Ratings are well-calibrated: predicted win probabilities match actual outcomes\n",
    "- Season-to-season mean reversion (25%) helps handle roster turnover in junior comps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Win Probability\n",
    "- The gradient boosting model significantly outperforms coin-flip and home-always baselines\n",
    "- **Elo difference is the dominant predictor**, followed by recent form and scoring patterns\n",
    "- The model is well-calibrated across the probability range\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "- **Player clustering** — group players by development trajectory (early bloomers, steady climbers, etc.)\n",
    "- **In-game win probability** — quarter-by-quarter updates\n",
    "- **Transfer market** — predict which players will change clubs\n",
